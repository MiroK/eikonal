1. For linear solvers we need to check the order of convergence in L1, and L2
   norm so we need appropriate UFL stuff.

2. The exact solution for two circle problem is obtained from Expression wheras
   the other problems have exact solution as a function.

3. We need function to seed a point, a line, circle, polygon and two circles. 

class TestProblem
{
  1. return the exact solution in any FunctionSpace V, distance/signed distance
  // FOCUS ON DISTANCE
  2. if a function in V is passed; initialize it such tha values in cells
     intersected by 0 level set are set with the correct solution and elso
     we have big positive values(distance) or big posive/negative values 
     outside/inside(signed distance).
}

class Test
{
  1. It has some name=name of the file where the results are stored
  2. for N in n_elements:
    mesh->FunctionSpace->TestProblem(V),Solver(V), solver.solve() --> get the
    |u - u_exact| and iter count. store these in a filter. 
}
